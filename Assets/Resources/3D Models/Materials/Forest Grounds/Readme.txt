Forest Grounds - Terrain Texture Pack for Unity 3D
Don Whitaker and MotherNatureTextures.com

50 original, seamless textures prepared for use with Unity 3D. Each texture includes a Diffuse shaded material for terrains and a Bump/Specular version for scenery and details. All of these textures were created from my own digital photos - no recyced freebies or stale images here. 

You should also find a .zip file in the project's asset folder that contains all of the individual maps for each texture - color, specular, normal, occlusion. You can use these to fine tune your materials or to texture items in your other 3D apps.

Thanks and have fun texturing!
